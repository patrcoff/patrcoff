- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @patrcoff
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in open source software, IT tools, exploring development as a potential career pivot from IT Support
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning python, sql, software development practices, linux administration.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: my first collaboration... While I have dabbled with Python for many years, I have only recently felt that I have gathered a sort of 'memonetum' in my learning. I hope to develop my experience with the language and surrounding skills more rapidly this year than any before. A key part of this would be to begin to work collaboratively on some projects. I would be keen to explore this further in 2023 and if anyone would like me to get involved with their project, or wants to get involved in one of mine (see below for details about my projects), then I'd be very happy to hear from you!
- üì´ How to reach me - for now, the best way would be to reach out on LinkedIn, if you don't already have another contact method for me. https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-coffey-b7a748b0


<h1>Projects</h1>

In 2023, my goal is to feature one project a month. These will be chosen mainly based on frameworks, technologies, paradigms or other general software development practices I want to learn. I should mention, I am not a software developer and am not in a software development role - while I may explore this as a career down the line, the main motivating factore for me at this time is from the enjoyment I get from using the Python language, as well as a desire for a creative (but still technical) outlet. In my day job I work in technical support, supporting enterprice customers of a popular patch management solution - Ivanti Security Controls. While an engaging and diverse role, it doesn't fulfill my creativity desires in exactly the way I would like - very few jobs do of course!

The projects I produce during this period of (ideally) rapid development of my skills and knowledge will be started in a specific month, with much of the bulk of the MVP being developed in said specific month. The goal is not however to start and complete each project within a one-month period, but rather to loosely assign an ongoing, living, breathing project based product, to one specific month where it was started and the bulk of the initial work performed. I will however likely start many more projects than these 12, and many I'm sure I will never complete. However the 12 projects assigned to specific months will not be abandoned, and must be brought up to a certain level of standard which I will be happy with displaying, at least for this stage in my development journey. As such, I will name each project as each month comes and goes so it is clear which project is associated with which month, and which are extraneous projects.

- January: Ideasaver3000 - a notes app datastructure and API. The main ideal here is that knowledge is interlinked, hard to categorise, comes in many shapes and sizes and I find traditional applications of knowledge storage, processing and visualisation don't fit well with my own brain. In this project, all notes, ideas, individual pieces of information are instances of the same class, with various metadata attributes which lend them to being interlinked and accessed from multiple front end applications with a wide variety of purposes, from simple note taking inputs, to project planning graphical interfaces, to daily reminder tools which analyse previous ideas, thoughts and personal goals and prompt actions based on them. This stems from my terrible habit of leaving unstructured notes in a vast array of locations, with the intention at the time being that I will later review the information, develop it, use it for inspiration of further ideas etc. Inevitably, the vast majority of my thoughts are lost to files, applications, messages, scraps of paper etc. I aim to resolve this by creating a central repository of my thoughts, which can handle the varying categories, types, shapes and sizzes of said thoughts and put them to good use now, tomorrow, in a month, a year etc. Essentially capturing the essance of my mind as a source for the development of future information. Maybe I won't like what I see but at least I will have a hopefully decent demonstration of a Flask app.
