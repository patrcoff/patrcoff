- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @patrcoff
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in open source software, IT tools, and am currently pivoting from IT Support to DevOps so anything in that realm is of great interest to me.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning terraform, go, python, sql, software development practices, linux administration, cloud infrastucture platforms such as Azure and AWS to name a few.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: ISECAPIPY*, and any public projects (mainly in Python) who would be willing to have me work with them. I am new to contributing and am keen to learn more about best practices for working on Open Source.
- üì´ How to reach me - for now, the best way would be to reach out on LinkedIn, if you don't already have another contact method for me. https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-coffey-b7a748b0

Over the past few months I have been a little quiet on my personal GitHub for the following reasons:

- I have been working towards a microcredential with the OU in AWS ML which has been done mainly within a cloud learning environment and taken most of my extra curricular attention since the beginning of summer.
- I have started a new job, where I have recevied extensive training over 8 weeks in the form of what the company calls an Academy. Sort of like a bootcamp but with more positives and fewer negatives (including a full wage from day 1). The role is Platform Engineer so I've been upskilling in cloud technologies, DevOps, CI/CD, IAC and more. I've been usng my coorporate GH account primarily during this time hence the blackout here. I hope to soon showcase some of my newer skills here as and when I find the time, now that the Academy has ended and I'm getting ready to onboard to project work.

<h2>ISECAPIPY</h2>

I ~~am~~ (had been) developing a Python package which is a wrapper for the Ivanti Security Controls Console REST API. This ~~is~~ was my first 'real world' project so to speak, and though I am proud of how the project ~~is~~ was going, I'm sure there are many improvements to be made in it (like finishing it). I was previously employed at Ivanti as a TSE supporting ISEC and it's due to my knowledge of this product that I ~~have~~ had chosen to focus on this project at ~~this~~ that point in my personal development. However, it should be noted that the project is fully Open Source and is based fully on publically available information about the ISEC product and its REST API. It is in no way affiliated with Ivanti itself and receives no support or funding from them. I would be keen to collaborate on this project with any actual customers of ISEC in order to get insights to desired functionality and real-world use cases.

I have since had no time to dedicate to this project due to significant time focus on learning cloud technologies, devops, and other upskilling related to my current role (Platform Engineer) as well as parenthood (who knew parenting could be so tiring!?). My wife has also been very unwell due to a condition called Hyperemisis Gravidarum which she had in her first pregnancy as well as now in he current pregnancy. This has resulted in very limited free time for me to focus on side projects outside of work. I highly recommend reading up on [HG and other such conditions](https://www.pregnancysicknesssupport.org.uk) for general awareness and if you can contribute anything, be that time or money, to good causes, please do so. I was not aware of this debilitating condition before my wife got pregnant with my daughter Lena and have been shocked at how poorly educated people even in the health industry are on it. It is not morning sickness, it is so much worse.

This goes for all my other projects from the past too, though I am leaving them up for transparency and posterity. I have also been mostly commiting code to official repositories inside my company and client's private repositories from my professional account(s), hence the limited activity on this account, which is a personal one. Hopefully at some point in the future I will have more time to dedicate to my personal portfolio and produce some hopefully interesting projects.
